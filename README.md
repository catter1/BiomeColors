# Biome Color Generator

This Python script will create a `biome_colors.json` for custom biome worldgen datapacks. This is made specifically for **jacobsjo**'s [MC Datapack Map](https://github.com/jacobsjo/mc-datapack-map) web application. Click [here](https://map.jacobsjo.eu/) to use the web application yourself.

## Formatting

The formatting of the `biome_colors.json` is as follows:
```json
{
    "mushroom_fields": { "r": 250, "g": 145, "b": 248 },
    "deep_frozen_ocean": { "r": 52, "g": 120, "b": 162 },
    ...
}
```

## How It Works

The Python script will generate RGB values in the formatting stated above. It decides this based on the temperature and downfall defined in each biome's individual json file in the `data/[namespace]/worldgen/biome` folder. Here is the simplified process the script goes through:

- **Low temperature**: more blue, less red/green
- **High temperature**: less blue, more red/green
- **Low Downfall**: more red than green
- **High Downfall**: less red than green

It should also be noted that in the script, you will see downfall referenced as humidity. Since the colors were brainstormed using layman's terms (what color should hot and wet biomes be?), it made sense to program them as such. I understand that this can be easily confused with noise parameters. The script does **not** take into account noise parameters.


# Running Script

1. This runs on **Python 3.10**. Older versions will not work, and newer versions are untested.

2. Clone the repository locally.

3. Install the required dependencies.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the script.
```bash
python3 biome_colors_generator.py <filepath> <namespace> [OPTIONS]
```
...where **filepath** is the *relative* filepath to the datapack directory, and **namespace** is the namespace which contains the custom biomes. Use the `--help` option to view more information.

## Showcase
Here is an example of what a map of Terralith 2.3.6 looks like using the `biome_colors.json` generated by this script.

# To Do:

- Continue tweaking colors
- If colors are too similar, separate them a little
- Potentially take into account vanilla biomes
- Potentially take into account custom foliage/grass colors, if available
